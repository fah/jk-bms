# jk-bms
A little python script to read jk-bms

Original from https://github.com/PurpleAlien/jk-bms_grafana

I just added some print statements.

## Installation

Just copy the script to your CERBO GX, for example, and type ```python printbms.py```.

To do that you have to enable root access via ssh first.
